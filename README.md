# Hand Gesture Classification 👍🏻👎🏻

A simple project where I trained a model using Teachable Machine to recognize two hand gestures: thumbs up 👍🏻 and thumbs down 👎🏻.
I trained the model with images, then tested it using a Python script with TensorFlow to see if it could correctly predict the gesture from an uploaded image.

## Classes:
- 👍🏻 Like
- 👎🏻 Dislike

## Files:
- keras_model.h5 (the trained model)
- labels.txt (class names)
- test.jpg (the test image)
- image_classification.ipynb (the script to run prediction)
